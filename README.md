                            Movies app
                            ----------

Files:


    CSS
      app-root.css
      films.css
      
    HTML
      app-root.html
      master-works.html
      
    JSON
      app-root.json
      master-works.json
  
  
How to try out the code:


    From a local folder, run either app-root.html or master-works.html in a Firefox browser.
    
    Note,
    json data is extracted from file hence security issues may arise using any other browser - whereas Firefox only issues a warning,
    this is fine for testing however ideally the files would reside on a web server.
